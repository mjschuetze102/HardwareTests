# HardwareTests
I am using this repo to store the base code needed to interface with the hardware components found in the [Elegoo Starter Kit](https://www.elegoo.com/product/elegoo-mega-2560-project-the-most-complete-starter-kit/).

![Elegoo Starter Kit](https://i0.wp.com/www.elegoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2560%E7%BB%88%E6%9E%81%E5%A5%97%E4%BB%B6%E7%BE%8E%E8%A7%84%EF%BC%89%EF%BC%8820161108%EF%BC%89.jpg?fit=1500%2C1500&ssl=1)

Each directory will hold code for one sensor module/ display/ motor/ etc, including the packages required to interface with them (if needed). Also included with be pinout diagrams for interacting with the hardware.
